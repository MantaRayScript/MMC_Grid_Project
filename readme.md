# COURSE PROJECT USING GRID

## ABOUT THE PROJECT

This project was made with MCC School Course part III, where we used the knowledge posessed in the previous courses and the latest one. It is strictly to show what I am doing in between personal projects which is working on my progress and building skills for my dream job. If you have any suggestions how to improve this project, feel free to write a message or contribute to this project. I'm looking for improvements! :wink:

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I want to thank [Mateusz Maj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateusz-maj-b003b6178/?originalSubdomain=pl) for the awesome job he does in his courses for Front-end Developer wannabies like me. I highly recommend his videos to any Polish speaking person who would like to learn about HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and more. Thanks to him I didn't loose my motivation and I'm progressing in Front-end knowledge. I hope one day to work as a developer. :heart:
